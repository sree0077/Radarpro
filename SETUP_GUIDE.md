   - [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

2. Press `a` in the terminal to launch on Android emulator

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Supabase Configuration Required

The app will run but **database features won't work** until you configure Supabase:

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for the project to be ready

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
3. Copy your:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon/Public Key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Replace these with your actual Supabase credentials
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here

# Keep this as is
EXPO_PUBLIC_EXPO_PROJECT_ID=95dfb103-d0ae-4aa6-b83c-0e1587be3450
```

### Step 4: Restart the Development Server
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the current server
2. Run `npm start` again
3. The database will be automatically initialized

## üîß Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Start for specific platform
npm run android    # Android only
npm run ios        # iOS only  
npm run web        # Web only

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

## üìã Package Version Warnings

The following packages have version mismatches but don't affect functionality:
- `react-native-reanimated@4.0.1` (expected: ~3.17.4)
- `@types/react@18.2.79` (expected: ~19.0.10)
- `typescript@5.9.2` (expected: ~5.8.3)

These can be updated later if needed.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Configure Supabase** (see above) to enable all features
2. **Test the app** on your mobile device using Expo Go
3. **Explore the features**:
   - User authentication (sign up/sign in)
   - Interactive map with location services
   - Report creation and viewing
   - Real-time notifications
   - Media upload (photos/audio)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If the app crashes on startup:
1. Check that Supabase is properly configured
2. Restart the development server
3. Clear Expo cache: `npx expo start --clear`

### If you see "Network Error":
1. Make sure your device and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. Check firewall settings
3. Try the web version first

### If location features don't work:
1. Grant location permissions when prompted
2. Test on a physical device (location doesn't work well in simulators)

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the terminal output for error messages
2. Restart the development server
3. Clear cache and try again
4. Check that all environment variables are properly set
